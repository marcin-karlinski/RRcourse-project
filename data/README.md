## Data description

Every pulsar rotates periodically, and with every rotation produces a slightly different signal. Every observation (a candidate signal) in the data set is an average over many rotations. In the data set there are 17898 observations and 9 variables. Every candidate is described by 8 features, 4 that relate to the integrated pulse profile, and 4 that characterize the dispersion measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (DM_SNR) curve. Target class is a label given by an annotator stating whether the signal came from a pulsar star or was just a result of an interference.

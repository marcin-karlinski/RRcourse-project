Results of the R analysis can be found in the csv files glm_conf_matrix_R and rf_conf_matrix_R and results of the Python analysis in 
files with the same name but '_Python' at the end instead of '_R'. 
Accuracy was similiar for both models (0.9598 and 0.9698 respectively in R and 0.95 and 0.96 in Python), however in such a case, a particular emphasis was put on
the accuracy of classification of positive class (since this information is much more precious for researchers studying pulsar stars).
Hence, sensitivity (or recall, the percentage of correctly classified observations with a positive class among all the observations with a positive class),
was higher for logistic regression model (0.931 in R algorithm and 0.92 in Python vs 0.793 for random forest in R and 0.83 in Python). 
Based on that we concluded that the original conclusion still stands and logistic regression may be better suited for this task.
